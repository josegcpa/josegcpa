**Hi! I’m José Guilherme de Almeida, a post-doctoral researcher** with the [Computational Clinical Imaging Group](https://fchampalimaud.org/research/groups/papanikolaou) at the Champalimaud Foundation. I am interested in developing robust predictive methods for (semi-)automated diagnosis and prognosis from clinical images and data.

**Previously**, I did my PhD with Moritz Gerstung and George S. Vassiliou at the EMBL-EBI and my MSc thesis with Irina Moreira at Universidade de Coimbra.

**I am interested in** deep-learning, computer vision and computational oncobiology. I am also a big fan of data visualization (i.e. [Pure Ideology!](https://pure-ideology.netlify.app/), one of my favourite projects) and do some [musical production](https://josegcpa.net/zga-tree) on my free time.
